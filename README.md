```bash
# Only for Windows
wsl

# Install node modules
npm install

# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Before opening the app, go to frontend directory inside `src` and run:

## Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
