## Running the project locally

To run the project locally, go to project root directory and follow this command:

```bash
# Only for Windows
wsl

# Install node modules
npm install

# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Before opening the app, go to frontend directory inside `src` and run:

```bash
# Install frontend node modules
npm install
```

## Running the AI service locally

To run the AI service locally, go to `face-recognition` directory, and follow this command:

`*Notes*`<br />
*Make sure you have python installed in local machine*<br />
*When you first running the app, the process will take more time as it will download the AI model first (estimated 500MB++)*<br />

```bash
# Install python library needed
pip install deepface
pip install flask
pip install flask-cors

# Run the app
flask run --port=1234

## Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
